#1. Use the dataset mpg
#A data frame with 234 rows and 11 variables:
#’ \describe{
#’ \item{manufacturer}{manufacturer name}
#’ \item{year}{year of manufacture}
#’ \item{model}{model name}
#’ \item{displ}{engine displacement, in litres}
#’ \item{cyl}{number of cylinders}
#’ \item{trans}{type of transmission}
#’ \item{drv}{the type of drive train, where f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd}
#’ \item{cty}{city miles per gallon}
#’ \item{hwy}{highway miles per gallon}
#’ \item{fl}{fuel type}
#’ \item{class}{"type" of car}
#’ }
"mpg"



#A.
#1st download the mpg.csv file
#2nd upload the mpg file in the posit cloud or r studio by clicking the upload in the file/plot tab
#3rd click the mpg.csv file in the files/plot tab and click import data set
